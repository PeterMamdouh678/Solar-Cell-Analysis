# Solar-Cell-Analysis
Analysis the data taken from real life experience to get a certain output related to Solar cells improvement:
•	Understanding the Data and the needed output.
•	Design an algorithm to reach the output with the needed charts.
•	Implement Machine Learning algorithm to know about the differences between the data with different protocols to get us the best combination of inputs to reach the best results related to solar cells.
